+Lexer, the tokenizer component:
	-first of all, check that every qoute/double quote/parenthesis is closed properly.
	-parse the command block given and create a "t_tkns" for each type in the command block, resulting in a linked list of "t_tkns".
	-for the above step, a fucntion will be created to identify each type, and the needed types are:
		AND, OR
		PIPE
		REDR_O
		REDR_I
		HERE_DOC
		WHITE_SPC
		QUOTE
		DQUOTE
		PARENTHESIS
		VAR
		WORD
	-while identifying the types. the state (whether inside qoute/double quote/parenthesis or not), value and length of the value itself will be set.
